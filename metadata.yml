title: Our World In Data SQlite Database
description_html: |-
  <p>This <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> instance exposes a database that is a copy of the metadata and prose content of the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org">Our World In Data Website</a>. It enables
   queries against the full text of our articles, filter variables by name and date added etc. Only the text of published articles is included at this time.</p>
  <p>
    This database does not contain all the data that Our World In Data keeps and thus can't be used to plot graphs. The schema of this database is expected to
    evolve along with the needs of our internal tools. For any feedback or to follow development check out the <a href="https://github.com/owid/owid-datasette">projects github repository</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This Datasette instance also features the jupyterlite plugin so you can use the pyodide notebook setup to write python notebooks that are evaluated in
    your browser. Navigate to <a href="/jupyterlite/">/jupyterlite/</a> to get started and refer to the <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-jupyterlite">plugin docs</a> for more information on how to get started.

          <p>This table contains the information used by our <a href="https://github.com/owid/owid-grapher">Grapher datavisualisation tool</a> to render charts. </p>
          <p>The most relevant field is the config field that contains json stored as text. A <a href="https://owid.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/schemas/grapher-schema.001.json">JSON Schema</a>
             is available that describes the content of this json data. The SQLite JSON_EXTRACT function can be used in SQL queries to extract the content of this JSON data into columns in a result table.

      datasets:
        sort_desc: id
        label_column: name
        description: This table contains information on all the datasets we publish. Variables are linked to a dataset in a n:1 relationship
      namespaces:
        sort_desc: id
        label_column: name
        description: |
          Namespaces are used inside Our World In Data to group datasets together. Roughly it can be said that datsets in the "owid"
          namespace were uploaded as individual datasets (often directly by authors), whereas the other namespaces contain datasets that
          are bulk imported from an upstream data provider that gives the namespace it's name (e.g. the WHO)
      post_tags:
        description: Relationship table to link posts and tags
      posts:
        sort_desc: id
        label_column: title
        description: |
          This table contains the full text for all our posts in html form. The format is a bit odd as it represents a direct copy from
          wordpress content that includes a lot of wordpress specific comments that carry some meaning in terms of layout instructions etc..
          The html in the content column can thus be rendered as is but will not look identical to the way it looks on our website as several
          post processing steps are not applied yet. The content should work though as a readable approximation for every post.
      sources:
        sort_desc: id
        label_column: name
        description: |
          This table contains all the sources for our datasets. The description column contains JSON encoded as text that contains useful
          additional fields like a longer descriptive text "additionalInfo".
      tags:
        sort_desc: id
        label_column: name
        description: Tags used in the database for various entities
      users:
        sort_desc: id
        label_column: fullName
        description: Table with all our users with write access
      variables:
        sort_desc: id
        label_column: name
        description: |
          This table contains all the variables of all the datasets we have at Our World In Data. Note that this includes only the information about the
          variables like name and default display settings, not the data itself.
      post_links:
        sort_desc: postId
        description: |
          This table is generated from the HTML content of the posts table and extracts different kinds of linked content.
          The kinds of links currently used are: internal_link, external_link and image.
      post_charts:
        sort_desc: postId
        description: |
          This table is generated from the HTML content of the posts table and extracts iframe links to grapher charts.
      variable_statistics:
        description: |
          This table contains a some summary statistics about the data values for most variables. For historical and performance
          reasons, creating this table is currently done at different intervals than the rest of the sqlite dump and so the very
          most recent variables may not be present in this statistics table.
      post_html_tags:
        description: |
          This table extracts all html tags and their attributes from the posts table's content. This is useful for statistics for the backporting
          wordpress to ArchieML project. Note that both opening and closing tags are listed here.
      post_wp_tags:
        description: |
          This table extracts all special wordpress comment tags from the posts table's content. This is useful for statistics for the backporting
          wordpress to ArchieML project. Note that both opening and closing tags are listed here so if you calculate counts etc you will want to
          divide by two to get the correct number.
