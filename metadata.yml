title: Our World In Data SQlite Database
description_html: |-
  <p>This <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> instance exposes a database that is a copy of the metadata and prose content of the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org">Our World In Data Website</a>. It enables
   queries against the full text of our articles, filter variables by name and date added etc.</p>
  <p>
    This database does not contain all the data that Our World In Data keeps and thus can't be used to plot graphs. The schema of this database is expected to
    evolve along with the needs of our internal tools. For any feedback or to follow development check out the <a href="https://github.com/owid/owid-datasette">projects github repository</a>.

          <p>This table contains the information used by our <a href="https://github.com/owid/owid-grapher">Grapher datavisualisation tool</a> to render charts. </p>
          <p>The most relevant field is the config field that contains json stored as text. A <a href="https://owid.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/schemas/grapher-schema.001.json">JSON Schema</a>
             is available that describes the content of this json data. The SQLite JSON_EXTRACT function can be used in SQL queries to extract the content of this JSON data into columns in a result table.
          </p>
          <p>
            For convenience, a view with the name charts_view is provided that contains the same content as this table but extracts a few of the most commonly used fields from the JSON data in the config column
            into separate columns.

          <p>This view extends the charts table by a few convenience fields extracted from the config into separate colums.</p>
          <p>Just like the underlying charts table, this view contains the information used by our <a href="https://github.com/owid/owid-grapher">Grapher datavisualisation tool</a> to render charts. </p>
          <p>The most relevant field is the config field that contains json stored as text. A <a href="https://owid.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/schemas/grapher-schema.001.json">JSON Schema</a>
             is available that describes the content of this json data. The SQLite JSON_EXTRACT function can be used in SQL queries to extract the content of this JSON data into columns in a result table.
             The commonly used fields title, subtitle, note and a few more have already been extracted into columns in this view.

      dataset_tags:
        description: Relationship table to link datasets and tags
      datasets:
        sort_desc: id
        label_column: name
        description: This table contains information on all the datasets we publish. Variables are linked to a dataset in a n:1 relationship
      namespaces:
        sort_desc: id
        label_column: name
        description: |
          Namespaces are used inside Our World In Data to group datasets together. Roughly it can be said that datsets in the "owid"
          namespace were uploaded as individual datasets (often directly by authors), whereas the other namespaces contain datasets that
          are bulk imported from an upstream data provider that gives the namespace it's name (e.g. the WHO)
      post_tags:
        description: Relationship table to link posts and tags
      posts:
        sort_desc: id
        label_column: title
        description: |
          This table contains the full text for all our posts in html form. The format is a bit odd as it represents a direct copy from
          wordpress content that includes a lot of wordpress specific comments that carry some meaning in terms of layout instructions etc..
          The html in the content column can thus be rendered as is but will not look identical to the way it looks on our website as several
          post processing steps are not applied yet. The content should work though as a readable approximation for every post.
      sources:
        sort_desc: id
        label_column: name
        description: |
          This table contains all the sources for our datasets. The description column contains JSON encoded as text that contains useful
          additional fields like a longer descriptive text "additionalInfo".

          For convenience, a view with the name sources_view is provided that contains the same content as this table but extracts a few of the most commonly used fields from the JSON data in the description column
          into separate columns.
      sources_view:
        sort_desc: id
        label_column: name
        description: |
          This view extends the sources table by a few convenience fields extracted from the description field into separate colums.

          Like the underlying table, this view contains all the sources for our datasets.
      tags:
        sort_desc: id
        label_column: name
        description: Tags used in the database for various entities
      users:
        sort_desc: id
        label_column: fullName
        description: Table with all our users with write access
      variables:
        sort_desc: id
        label_column: name
        description: |
          This table contains all the variables of all the datasets we have at Our World In Data. Note that this includes only the information about the
          variables like name and default display settings, not the data itself.
