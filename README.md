This repository is a test to see if a read only SQLite copy and a [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) instance of the main Our World In Data database is useful. The SQlite DB contains the metadata on variables, datasets, namespaces and sources as well as the pages including their full markup. What is not included are all the data of the variables (i.e. you can't plot any variable with just this database but you could e.g. find all pages that mention the word "forest").

The database is generated in the analytics repo and uploaded to S3. In `update.sh` we fetch the latest version for datasette-private.
